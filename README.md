Project Name: Multiple Process Management

Description:

This project demonstrates multi-process management in a Unix environment using C programming. It consists of two main components: oss (the parent process) and worker (the child process). oss is responsible for launching and managing multiple worker processes with specific parameters.

Instructions:

Compilation:

Ensure you have GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) installed on your system.

Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory where oss.c, worker.c, and the Makefile are located.

To compile the project, run the following command:

Type command "make"
This will compile both oss.c and worker.c and generate the oss and worker executables.

Running the Program:
type "./oss -n <total_children> -s <simultaneous_children> -t <iterations>"
example :
./oss -n 5 -s 3 -t 7
This command will launch oss with 5 total children, allow a maximum of 3 children to run simultaneously, and specify 7 iterations per child.

Cleaning Up:
To remove the compiled executables, use the following command:
type "make clean"
This will delete the oss and worker executables.

Note:

Make sure code is correctly written in oss.c and worker.c, and that the Makefile is configured properly for the project.
System-specific settings needs to be adjusted , such as file permissions, to ensure that you can execute the compiled programs.
